"After a transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, it may be included in a block that is published to the network. When that happens, it is said that the transaction has been mined at a depth of 1 block. With each subsequent block that is found, the number of blocks deep is increased by one. To be secure against double spending, a transaction should not be considered as confirmed until it is a certain number of blocks deep.\nA good rule of thumb is that 1 confirmation is good for small value amounts of bitcoins and a user should wait for more confirmations for larger value amounts.\nArcBit will display the confirmation number up until the 6th confirmation." = "在交易被廣播到比特幣網路之後，它可能被包含在發佈到網路的塊中。當這種情況發生時，意味著這筆交易已經被開採了1個區塊的深度。隨著後續區塊的陸續開採，此塊的深度逐步增加。為了防止雙重支出，交易在達到一定的區塊深度之前不應該被視為得到確認。\n一個較好的經驗法則是，對於小額支付，1個確認深度是合適的；對於較大的金額，用戶應該等待更多的確認深度。\nArcBit將顯示確認深度直到達到6個。";

"Some people have compared bitcoin addresses to a bank routing number. It is a good analogy, however bitcoin addresses are public. So if you reuse the same bitcoin address for multiple payments like you would a routing number, people will be able to figure out how much bitcoin you have. Thus it is recommended that you only use one address per payment.\nThis causes usability issues making the user use a new address whenever receiving a payment is cumbersome.\nStealth/reusable addresses provides a better solution. When you give a sender a reusable address, the sender will derive a one time regular bitcoin address from the reusable address. Then the sender will send a payment to that regular bitcoin address. Now you can give many people just one reusable address and have them all send you payments without letting other people know how much bitcoin you have.\nA reusable address looks like this vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE. A reusable address is a lot longer then a regular bitcoin address, it is 102 characters in length.\nReusable addresses are great, however there are no other mobile bitcoin wallets but ArcBit that supports reusable addresses for now. Which is why ArcBit supports receiving payments from both regular bitcoin addresses and reusable addresses.\nFor each account, you have one reusable address. You can find it on your Receive screen. Swipe all the way to right on the QRCode on your Receive screen and you will find a reusable address." = "有些人將比特幣位址與銀行路由號碼進行了比較。這是一個很好的比喻。不過，比特幣地址是公開的。因此，如果您重複使用相同的比特幣位址進行多次付款（就像您的路由號碼），則人們將能夠計算出您擁有多少比特幣。因此，建議您每個位址只收一次款。\n但是要求用戶在每次收款時換用新地址是很麻煩的，這會導致可用性問題。\n隱形地址/可重用地址提供了更好的解決方案。當您給付款人一個可重用位址時，付款人將從可重用位址得到一個一次性的比特幣位址。然後付款人會發送一個支付到該位址。現在您可以給許多人同一個可重用位址，讓他們都給您付款，而不會讓別人知道您有多少比特幣。\n一個可重用位址看起來像這樣：vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE。可重用位址的長度為102個字元，比普通的比特幣位址長得多。\n可重用位址非常棒，但是到目前為止，除了ArcBit，還沒有其他比特幣手機錢包支持。這就是為什麼ArcBit支援從常規比特幣位址和可重用位址接收付款的原因。\n對於每個帳戶，您都有一個可重用位址。在接收螢幕上一直向右滑動二維碼，您就可以找到它。";
